# Epic Feature Index: Public Launch & Monetization Strategy

## 📋 Overview

This epic transforms StoryWriter from a single-user, self-hosted tool into a public, multi-tiered SaaS service. The implementation is divided into 5 detailed features that build upon each other to create a complete monetization-ready platform.
