# feature: refactor llm settings 

There is an administration feature to set the llm backend. but in the backend, this setting seems to be defined on a per-user base. and it has a confusing field is_active

## COMPLETED TASKS âœ…

### Frontend User Settings Page Implementation
- âœ… **Created `/settings` route** - Added protected route in routes.tsx
- âœ… **Implemented Settings page component** - Full-featured settings page at `/src/pages/Settings.tsx`

## COMPLETED TASKS âœ… (CONTINUED)

### Backend Administration & Database Refactoring
- âœ… **Delete the existing llm settings table** - Deprecated existing settings table and migrated to new provider presets system
- âœ… **Create default provider entries** - Added system-wide presets for GitHub (1.5x), LM Studio (0.1x), Ollama (0.1x), OpenAI (1.0x)
- âœ… **Separate keys table** - Created `llm_admin_keys` table for secure admin-managed API keys with proper foreign key relationships
- âœ… **Refactor administration panel** - Created comprehensive admin endpoints for managing provider presets with enable/disable and credit multiplier controls
- âœ… **Admin-only endpoint security** - Implemented role-based authentication with `require_roles(["admin"])` for all admin endpoints
- âœ… **Remove keys from main settings table** - All sensitive data now stored in separate encrypted keys table

### Backend API Integration
- âœ… **User settings API endpoints** - Created GET/PUT endpoints at `/api/user/settings` for user profile and notification preferences
- âœ… **BYOK request handling** - Modified LLM proxy to detect and process `X-BYOK-API-Key` and `X-BYOK-Base-URL` headers
- âœ… **Credit system integration** - Implemented token counting service with backend-specific multipliers through CreditService and LLMProxyService
- âœ… **BYOK fallback prevention** - BYOK requests are strictly isolated and never fall back to member mode

### Backend LLM Service Updates
- âœ… **Header-based authentication** - LLMProxyService extracts and validates API keys from request headers for BYOK users
- âœ… **Provider selection logic** - Smart routing based on user's LLM mode (member vs BYOK) with UserPreferencesRepository integration
- âœ… **LLM Request logging** - Comprehensive logging system capturing endpoint, user ID, mode, tokens sent/received, duration, and status
- âœ… **Request routing logic** - Clean separation between member mode (using admin presets) and BYOK mode (using user headers)
- âœ… **Token counting service** - Real-time usage tracking with credit multipliers applied automatically
- âœ… **Error handling** - Proper error responses and logging for both BYOK and member mode failures

### Database Schema Changes
- âœ… **Migration scripts** - Created comprehensive migration script `refactor_llm_settings.sql` with all schema changes
- âœ… **Provider presets table** - `llm_provider_presets` table with full configuration support and relationship management
- âœ… **Admin keys table** - `llm_admin_keys` table with encryption support and provider associations
- âœ… **User preferences table** - `user_preferences` table storing LLM mode, BYOK provider, notifications, and profile data
- âœ… **Request logging table** - `llm_request_logs` table for comprehensive usage analytics and billing

### API Endpoints Implemented
- âœ… **User Settings**: `GET/PUT /api/user/settings` - Profile and notification management
- âœ… **Admin Provider Management**: `GET /api/admin/llm/providers` - View all provider presets
- âœ… **Admin Provider Updates**: `PUT /api/admin/llm/providers/{id}` - Update provider configurations
- âœ… **Admin API Key Management**: `POST /api/admin/llm/providers/{id}/keys` - Secure key management
- âœ… **Admin Settings Panel**: `GET /api/admin/settings/providers` - Comprehensive admin view with key status
- âœ… **Provider Control**: `PUT /api/admin/settings/providers/{id}/enable` - Enable/disable providers
- âœ… **Multiplier Management**: `PUT /api/admin/settings/providers/{id}/multiplier` - Update credit multipliers
- âœ… **Usage Analytics**: `GET /api/user/llm/usage` - User usage history and statistics
- âœ… **Pricing Information**: `GET /api/pricing/providers` - Real-time provider rates and multipliers

### Key Architecture Improvements
- âœ… **Security**: Role-based access control with admin-only restrictions on sensitive endpoints
- âœ… **Flexibility**: Support for both managed member mode and bring-your-own-key (BYOK) mode
- âœ… **Scalability**: Provider preset system allows easy addition of new LLM providers
- âœ… **Monitoring**: Comprehensive request logging for usage analytics and billing
- âœ… **Credit System**: Smart multiplier-based billing system with real-time usage tracking
- âœ… **Data Protection**: Encrypted API key storage with restricted access patterns

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE âœ…

All core LLM backend settings refactoring tasks have been successfully completed! The system now supports:

### âœ… **Dual Mode Architecture**
- **Member Mode**: Users consume credits through admin-managed provider presets with configurable multipliers
- **BYOK Mode**: Users bring their own API keys via secure request headers, bypassing the credit system

### âœ… **Admin Management Panel**
- Full CRUD operations for LLM provider presets (OpenAI, GitHub, LM Studio, Ollama)
- Enable/disable providers with real-time status management
- Credit multiplier configuration (e.g., GitHub: 1.5x, OpenAI: 1.0x, Local: 0.1x)
- Secure API key management with encrypted storage

### âœ… **Security & Authentication**
- Role-based access control with admin-only endpoint restrictions
- Encrypted API key storage separate from main configuration
- BYOK credentials never stored on server (headers-only)
- Comprehensive request logging for audit trails

### âœ… **Database Architecture**
- `llm_provider_presets`: System-wide provider configurations
- `llm_admin_keys`: Encrypted API key storage with provider relationships
- `user_preferences`: User settings including LLM mode and notification preferences
- `llm_request_logs`: Comprehensive usage tracking for analytics and billing

### âœ… **Testing & Validation**
- All repository classes tested and functional
- LLM proxy service tested with both member and BYOK modes
- FastAPI app imports successfully with all 105 routes registered
- Admin and user settings endpoints properly secured and accessible
