# Character Photo Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Backend Changes

1. **Database Schema** (`/backend/data/db.py`)
   - ✅ Added `character_photos` table with fields:
     - `id`, `user_id`, `scenario_id`, `character_id`
     - `filename`, `original_filename`, `file_size`, `mime_type`
     - `created_at` timestamp
   - ✅ Added database indexes for efficient lookups
   - ✅ Table created in existing database

2. **Character Photo Controller** (`/backend/controllers/character_photo_controller.py`)
   - ✅ `/api/characters/create-from-photo` - Upload photo and generate character
   - ✅ `/api/character-photos/<photo_id>` - Get and delete photo endpoints
   - ✅ File validation (type, size limits)
   - ✅ Image compression and storage
   - ✅ AI character generation (prototype implementation)

3. **Flask App Integration** (`/backend/app.py`)
   - ✅ Registered character photo blueprint
   - ✅ Added Pillow dependency to requirements.txt

4. **File Storage**
   - ✅ Created `/uploads/photos/` directory
   - ✅ Unique filename generation with UUIDs

### Frontend Changes

1. **Data Model** (`/frontend/src/types/ScenarioTypes.ts`)
   - ✅ Updated Character interface with `photoId` and `photoUrl` fields

2. **Photo Upload Modal** (`/frontend/src/components/ScenarioEditor/tabs/PhotoUploadModal.tsx`)
   - ✅ Drag-and-drop photo upload interface
   - ✅ File validation and preview
   - ✅ Optional character details form (name, role, additional prompt)
   - ✅ API integration with backend endpoint
   - ✅ Error handling and user feedback

3. **Characters Tab Integration** (`/frontend/src/components/ScenarioEditor/tabs/CharactersTab.tsx`)
   - ✅ Added "Create from photo..." button
   - ✅ Modal integration and state management
   - ✅ Character creation handler
   - ✅ Photo deletion when character is removed

4. **Styling** (`/frontend/src/components/ScenarioEditor/tabs/PhotoUploadModal.css`)
   - ✅ Modern, responsive modal design
   - ✅ Drag-and-drop visual feedback
   - ✅ Photo preview functionality

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Backend endpoints registered correctly
- ✅ Database table created successfully
- ✅ Created test script for manual verification (`/test_photo_upload.py`)

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The feature is fully implemented and ready for testing. To test:

1. **Start the backend:** `./start-backend.sh`
2. **Start the frontend:** `./start-frontend.sh`
3. **Or run the test script:** `python test_photo_upload.py`

## 📝 Usage Flow

1. User clicks "Create from photo..." button in Characters tab
2. Modal opens with drag-and-drop photo upload
3. User uploads photo and optionally fills character details
4. Backend processes photo, generates character attributes using AI
5. New character is added to the scenario with photo attached
6. Photo is automatically deleted if character is removed

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Replace prototype AI with real multimodal model (Gemma3)
- Add photo editing/cropping tools
- Batch photo upload for multiple characters
- Photo gallery view for characters
