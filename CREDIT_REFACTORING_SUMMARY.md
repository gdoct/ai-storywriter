# Credit Management System Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully refactored the credit management system to solve synchronization issues between multiple credit badges and provide centralized credit state management.

## Problems Solved

### Before
- **Two separate auth contexts** (`AuthContext` and `AuthenticatedUserContext`)
- **Independent credit fetching** - each `CreditsBadge` made its own API calls
- **Credit sync issues** - badges could show different values
- **Manual refresh triggers** - complex `refreshTrigger` prop system
- **Missing credit refresh** in some flows (marketplace donations)
- **Unnecessary AIStatusContext** (still preserved as it's actively used)

### After
- **Single enhanced AuthContext** with integrated credit management
- **Centralized credit state** - all badges use the same data source
- **Automatic synchronization** - all credit displays update together
- **Simplified API** - no more refresh triggers, just call `refreshCredits()`
- **Complete coverage** - credit refresh works everywhere (AI requests, payments, donations)

## Technical Changes

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (`/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `refreshCredits()` function to `AuthContextType`
- Enhanced `refreshProfile()` to fetch credits when not included in profile
- Added dedicated `refreshCredits()` method for standalone credit updates
- Made `credits` field required in `UserProfile` type

### 2. Simplified CreditsBadge (`/components/TopBar/CreditsBadge.tsx`)
- Removed internal state management (`useState` for credits, loading, error)
- Removed `refreshTrigger` prop system
- Now uses `useAuth()` to get credits directly from context
- Significantly reduced component complexity

### 3. Updated Credit Refresh Calls
- **AI Operations**: `CharactersTab.tsx`, `ChatAgent.tsx`, `BackstoryTab.tsx`
- **Marketplace Donations**: `StoryDetail.tsx`
- **Payment Success**: `BuyCredits.tsx`

### 4. Removed Redundant Context
- Removed `AuthenticatedUserProvider` from `App.tsx`
- Updated all components to use `useAuth()` instead of `useAuthenticatedUser()`

### 5. Cleaned Up Component Props
- Removed `creditRefreshTrigger` from `HeaderSection` props
- Updated `Marketplace.tsx` and `AuthenticatedNav.tsx` accordingly

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **No more out-of-sync credit badges**
- ✅ **Instant credit updates** after all transactions
- ✅ **Consistent experience** across the app

### For Developers
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for credit data
- ✅ **Simpler API** - just call `refreshCredits()` when needed
- ✅ **Reduced complexity** - fewer contexts, fewer props
- ✅ **Better performance** - fewer API calls
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - centralized credit logic

## Usage Examples

### After AI Request
```typescript
const { refreshCredits } = useAuth();
// ... make AI request ...
await refreshCredits(); // Updates all badges
```

### After Payment
```typescript
const { refreshCredits } = useAuth();
// ... process payment ...
await refreshCredits(); // Credits appear everywhere
```

### After Donation
```typescript
const { refreshCredits } = useAuth();
// ... donate credits ...
await refreshCredits(); // Remaining credits updated
```

## Files Modified
- `/types/auth.ts` - Made credits required, added refreshCredits to interface
- `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with credit management
- `/components/TopBar/CreditsBadge.tsx` - Simplified to use context
- `/components/navigation/AuthenticatedNav.tsx` - Removed refresh trigger
- `/components/MarketPlace/HeaderSection.tsx` - Removed refresh trigger prop
- `/pages/Marketplace.tsx` - Updated HeaderSection usage
- `/pages/StoryDetail.tsx` - Added credit refresh after donation
- `/pages/BuyCredits.tsx` - Added credit refresh after payment
- `/components/ScenarioEditor/**/*.tsx` - Updated to use new auth context
- `/App.tsx` - Removed AuthenticatedUserProvider

## Future Improvements
- Consider removing `AIStatusContext` if it becomes truly unnecessary
- Add optimistic updates for better UX during credit operations
- Consider adding credit history/transaction log
- Add credit balance validation before expensive operations

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- All credit badges should now stay in sync
- Credit refresh should work after all transactions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
