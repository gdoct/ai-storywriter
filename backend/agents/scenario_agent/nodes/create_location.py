**LOCATION CREATION REQUEST:** "{classified_prompt}"

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Create a location that fits the scenario's genre, tone, and world
2. Ensure the location name doesn't conflict with existing locations
3. Make the location vivid and atmospheric
4. Consider how this location serves the story and characters
5. Return ONLY the new location as valid JSON
6. Do not include an ID field - it will be generated automatically

**REQUIRED LOCATION STRUCTURE:**
```json
{{
  "name": "Location Name",
  "description": "Detailed description of the location's appearance and features",
  "atmosphere": "The mood, feeling, and ambiance of the place",
  "significance": "Why this location is important to the story"
