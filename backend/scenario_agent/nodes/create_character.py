**CHARACTER CREATION REQUEST:** "{classified_prompt}"

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Create a character that fits the scenario's genre, tone, and world
2. Ensure the character name doesn't conflict with existing characters
3. Make the character compelling and well-developed
4. Consider how this character relates to the existing story elements
5. Return ONLY the new character as valid JSON
6. Do not include an ID field - it will be generated automatically

**REQUIRED CHARACTER STRUCTURE:**
```json
{{
  "name": "Character Name",
  "backstory": "Detailed character background and history",
  "personality": "Character traits, motivations, and quirks",
  "appearance": "Physical description and notable features",
  "role": "Character's role or function in the story"
}}
