**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Modify ONLY the aspects mentioned in the user's request
2. Keep all other location properties unchanged
3. Ensure the location fits well within the story world
4. Return ONLY the modified location as valid JSON
5. Maintain the same JSON structure and property names

**REQUIRED LOCATION STRUCTURE:**

  "name": "Location Name",
  "description": "Detailed location description",
  "atmosphere": "Mood and feeling of the place",
  "significance": "Importance to the story"
